# Home Builder
**This is a project I have used as a learning experiance. Some parts may not seem strait-forward or efficient (such as the inclusion of assembly) but this was for my learning so I includded these quirks so I could learn about diffrerent processes or laungages.**

With home builder you can build your dream home, unlike other games if it it doens't have a peice you want, you can add it!. This project is open-source, cross-platform and build to be as modular as possible for anyone who want to change, re-use, or update it.
